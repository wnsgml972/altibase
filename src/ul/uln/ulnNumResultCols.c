 * SQLNumResultCols 가 발생시키는 에러들의 정보
 *
 * SQLSTATE  Error
 *           Description
 *
 * O : Implementation Complete
 * X : Do not need to implement
 *   : Need to do
 *
 * [ ] 01000 General warning
 *           Driver-specific informational message. (Function returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO.)
 * [ ] 08S01 Communication link failure
 *           The communication link between the driver and the data source to which the driver
 *           was connected failed before the function completed processing.
 * [ ] HY000 General error
 *           An error occurred for which there was no specific SQLSTATE and for which
 *           no implementation-specific SQLSTATE was defined.
 *           The error message returned by SQLGetDiagRec in the *MessageText buffer describes
 *           the error and its cause.
 * [ ] HY001 Memory allocation error
 *           The driver was unable to allocate memory required to support execution or
 *           completion of the function.
 * [ ] HY008 Operation canceled
 *           Asynchronous processing was enabled for the StatementHandle.
 *           The function was called, and before it completed execution,
 *           SQLCancel was called on the StatementHandle; the function was then
 *           called again on the StatementHandle.
 *           The function was called, and before it completed execution,
 *           SQLCancel was called on the StatementHandle from a different thread in
 *           a multithread application.
 * [ ] HY010 Function sequence error
 *           (DM) The function was called prior to calling SQLPrepare or SQLExecDirect
 *           for the StatementHandle.
 *           (DM) An asynchronously executing function (not this one) was
 *           called for the StatementHandle and was still executing
 *           when this function was called.
 *           (DM) SQLExecute, SQLExecDirect, SQLBulkOperations, or SQLSetPos was called for
 *           the StatementHandle and returned SQL_NEED_DATA.
 *           This function was called before data was sent for all data-at-execution parameters
 *           or columns.
 * [ ] HY013 Memory management error
 *           The function call could not be processed because the underlying memory objects
 *           could not be accessed, possibly because of low memory conditions.
 * [ ] HYT01 Connection timeout expired
 *           The connection timeout period expired before the data source responded to
 *           the request. The connection timeout period is set through SQLSetConnectAttr,
 *           SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT.
 * [ ] IM001 Driver does not support this function
 *           (DM) The driver associated with the StatementHandle does not support the function.
 *
 * SQLNumResultCols can return any SQLSTATE that can be returned by SQLPrepare or SQLExecute
 * when called after SQLPrepare and before SQLExecute, depending on when the data source
 * evaluates the SQL statement associated with the statement.
